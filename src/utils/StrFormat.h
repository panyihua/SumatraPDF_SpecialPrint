/*
str::Format() is similar to C# String.Format() i.e. we use positional {0}, {1}
formatting directives.

For backwards compatiblity, we also support %-style formatting directives.

Poistional args have 2 advantages:
- it's safer (no way to mismatch % directive and the type of the argument)
- it's more flexible. In some languages it's impossible to write a non-awkward
  translation without changing the order of words, which is impossible with %-style formatting

When using %-style formatting, we also verify the type of the argument is right.

Mixing %-style and {0}-style formatting is not supported.

TODO: once this is working and apptranslator.org has ability to rename translations, we should
change at least those translations that involve 2 or more substitutions.

TODO: an alternative would be to encode the argument list in the name of the function, like:
Fmt_iis(char *fmt, int arg1, int arg2, char *str) and write all Fmt_* permutations we use in
the code. The downside is we would need to write all those wrappers. The upside would be
smaller code (I imagine building Arg instance does take a few instructions at each Fmt
call site.
